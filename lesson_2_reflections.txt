What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository Git puts a .git file that contains meta data
that Git needs to manage your repository. Without telling Git that a particular
directory is a repository, Git could not know that it was supposed to be one.
Moreover, every repository has its own settings, I presume, and so Git has to
have some way of keeping track of those settings. I presume this is information
is held in the .git file.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a workspace while the repository represents work that is
being stored and the working directory represents work that is being considered
for storing in the repository. So that is how they are different. The value of
this workspace is that we have a place to put files we are not ready to commit
but at the same time need to work on and save in the staging area and then
commit them when (and only when) we are done.
