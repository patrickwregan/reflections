When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want to use a remote repository if you were collaborating with someone else 
over the internet. Also, you might use a remote repository if you were worried about 
the possibility of your computer failing and wanted a redundant copy of your work 
available on another computer.
